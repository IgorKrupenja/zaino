## Setup

Before starting, make sure that you have Node 16 installed ‚Äî or use something like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

### Common

1. [Install Google's Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) and run `gcloud auth login` to log in.
2. Run `npm install -g firebase-tools` to install Firebase CLI globally and run `firebase login` to log in.
3. Run `npm install` in the _root_ directory of the cloned/forked repo.
4. Go to [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/) and create two projects, one for **development** environment and one for **production** environment.
5. In Firebase console, create _Web_ apps for the two projects you created. Refer to this [article](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/9326094) for additional information.
6. In Firebase console, open Project Settings and note the Project IDs for the projects you created.
7. Create a `.firebaserc` file in the _root_ of this repo and add the Project IDs there. Example with dummy values below:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "development": "zaino-dev-3ea56",
    "production": "zaino-prod-236c2"
  }
}
```

### Web app

1. Go to Firebase console and open Project Settings for your projects.
2. Scroll down to Your Apps section and locate the code snippet with `firebaseConfig`.
3. Go to `packages/web-app` and create `.env.development` and `.env.production` files with the variables from `firebaseConfig`. Example with correct format and dummy values below:

```shell
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY="AIzaSkR_FfdseFcsE3fgg7pdjjjof6jhDSA-dTM"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="zaino-dev-3ea56.firebaseapp.com"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="https://zaino-dev-3ea56.firebaseio.com"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="zaino-dev-3ea56"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="zaino-dev-3ea56.appspot.com"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="550657824795"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID="1:550657824795:web:29da52b66934c3ea494f74"
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="G-EWJOIOADSK"
```

#### Caveats ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Most of the images used in the [live demo](#live-demo) were purchased from [GraphicRiver](https://graphicriver.net/) and [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) and cannot be made part of this repo due to copyright restrictions. To get images in the app, you can add your own to `packages/web-app/src/images/copyrighted` directory with the following structure:

```shell
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ categories
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ backpack.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ boots.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compass.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gloves.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gps.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hat.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hook.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jacket.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ knife.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pickaxe.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ poles.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shorts.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ socks.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ stove.svg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tent.svg
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mountain.svg <--- loader image
```

- Privacy policy content used in the [live demo](#live-demo) is not part of the repo. You can add your own to `packages/web-app/src/components/pages/PrivacyPolicyPage/PrivacyPolicyContent.tsx`. Otherwise, a placeholder will be shown.

### Firebase

1. Create a Firestore database in Firebase console for your projects, a detailed guide is available [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart#create).
2. Go to `packages/firebase` and create `.env.development` and `.env.production` files with the variables for your Project IDs. Example with dummy values below:

```shell
FB_PROJECT_ID="zaino-dev-3ea56"
```

Note: You can change additional settings like regions and Cloud Storage bucket name in [the `.env` file](packages/firebase/.env).

## Deployment

1. Make sure you did everything in [Setup](#setup) above.
2. Go to `packages/web-app` and run `npm run deploy` to deploy **production** or `npm run deploy-dev` to deploy **development**.
3. Go to `packages/firebase` and run `npm run deploy` to deploy **production** or `npm run deploy-dev` to deploy **development**.

Doing this will also enable periodic Firestore backups and seed it with demo data.

## Running locally

1. Make sure you did everything in [Setup](#setup) and [Deployment](#deployment) above.
2. Go to `packages/web-app`, run `npm start` and open [localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). This will _run against a deployed **development** Firebase project_.

## Code structure

<!-- TODO ONLY this section needs update -->
<!-- todo clean and shorten -->
<!-- todo mention workspaces -->

The project code is split into several [packages](packages). Each package is a separate [yarn workspace](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/blog/2017/08/02/introducing-workspaces/) to facilitate easier imports, e.g. `import { Labels, Colors } from '@zaino/shared'`. This is the reason why yarn was chosen over npm for this project as npm's workspace support is [only in beta at the moment](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/626173315965468672/npm-v7-series-beta-release-and-semver-major).

In the future, this structure can be used to accomodate additional sub-projects (like a landing page or a React Native app) as separate packages. At the moment, the packages are are:

### [shared](packages/shared)

A small (for the time being) amount of shared code (types). It also includes the demo data used in the app. The original in the CSV format is in [input-data.csv](packages/shared/src/demo-data/input-data.csv). It has been processed with a node script [processDemoData.ts](packages/shared/src/demo-data/processDemoData.ts), which can be modified and re-run with `yarn run process-demo-data`. Output data is in JSON format ([output-data.json](packages/shared/src/demo-data/output-data.json)) and is used by a Firebase function, see [below](####demo-data-and-firebase-functions).

### [cloud-functions](packages/web-app)

A couple of Firebase cloud functions including the function that populates Firestore with the demo data.

### [web-app](packages/web-app)

Main web app, code structure highlights:

- [src/components/](packages/web-app/src/components) App components and pages, along with per-component styles. Styles are mostly in SCSS and follow the BEM convention.
  - `Controls` Various reusable controls and form elements.
  - `Dashboard` Dashboard page components.
  - `Header` App header, including demo data loader.
  - `Icons` Several commonly re-used icons with applied styles.
  - `ItemModal` New/edit item modal components.
  - `LabelBadge` Fancy label badge components used throughout Dashboard and Labels pages.
  - `Labels` Labels page components.
  - `Misc` Various smaller components used throughout the app.
  - `Pages` App pages and temporary mobile placeholder.
  - `Selects` Core select component and re-useable and actual selects that use it. Note that the code is ugly here and needs refactoring, see [#346](https://github.com/igor-krupenja/zaino/issues/346).
  - `Wrappers` Various wrapper components used purely to align and style child components.
- [src/constants/](packages/web-app/src/constants) Built-in label colors and categories, will be moved to Firestore when customisation of these is implemented.
- [src/firebase/](packages/web-app/src/firebase) Firebase initialisation and a couple of functions to work with Firestore data.
- [src/routes/](packages/web-app/src/routes) React Router config and routes.
- [src/state/](packages/web-app/src/state) State management with Redux.
- [src/styles/](packages/web-app/src/styles) Style variables and settings that apply to the whole app.

## Technologies

- Typescript
- React, React Router, Redux
- Some React UI components: [React Select](https://react-select.com/home), [react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal), [react-tiny-popover](https://github.com/alexkatz/react-tiny-popover)
- SCSS (no frameworks)
- npm workspaces
- Cloud Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Firebase Functions, Google Cloud Storage, Firebase Hosting

## Functionality

- **Log-in with Google account**. Fast and secure log in with your Google account.
- **Data storage with Firestore**. Your data is safely stored in a Cloud Firestore database both with live demo and if you self-host Zaino.
- **Robust search and filtering**. Easily filter and sort your items by name, category, label, weight, etc.
- **Efficient packing for your next adventure**. Pack list offers a convenient overview of the items you want to take with you, including weight.
- **Flexible label system**. Organise your items in any way you want with custom labels.
- **Demo data**. Want to try the app without entering your own data first? Click Load under Demo data in header to populate your inventory with a comprehensive set of sample items. These can be easily removed later.
- **Self-hosting support**. Concerned about privacy and want to completely self-host your data? This is possible and I have provided a detailed guide in the [Setup](#setup) section below.
